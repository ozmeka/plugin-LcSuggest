# plugin-SuggestAnything
Enable autocomplete features for Omeka elements using the Library of Congress Authorities and Vocabularies service: http://id.loc.gov .  

This fork also adds the option to poll a Fill My List instance (see ozmeka/fillmylist) for simultaneous results from both US Library of Congress and Australian SCOT subjects.  Please note that this must be manually configured in the plugin setup as usual for LcSuggest.

Geonames place lookup support has been added as well.
