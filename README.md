# plugin-LcSuggest
Enable an autosuggest feature for Omeka elements using the Library of Congress Authorities and Vocabularies service: http://id.loc.gov

This fork also adds the option to poll a Fill My List instance (see ozmeka/chalege-2014) for simultaneous results from both US Library of Congress and Australian SCOT subjects.  Please note that this must be manually configured in the plugin setup as usual for LcSuggest.
